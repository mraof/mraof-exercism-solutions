# Echo Service

This is a introductory example to understand the concept of network interactions with Ballerina. As part of this 
exercise you will build a HTTP service that echos the same when you invoke over the HTTP.


The objectives are simple:

- Write a service that accepts HTTP POST request and echo the same message back to the client. 

## Running the tests

Prior to running the very first test case for Ballerina, you need to initialize your environment with: 
```sh
[~/Exercism/ballerina]$ ballerina init
```
You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering 
```sh
[~/Exercism/ballerina]$ ballerina test echo-service
```

in your terminal.
